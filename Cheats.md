# Cheats

## Overview

You can use these cheats in single player, or in multiplayer if the host allows it.

To enter cheats, simply type commands directly into the Chat input box (default Return key).

All cheat commands are preceded by a forward slash `/` character.

Most cheats can also be turned off, by following the command with the word 'off' (eg, `/warhead off` disables unlimited ammo)
