# Scenario Ideas

## Fastest through the tunnel (flying only)

Fly through the tunnel to see who can do it the fastest.
Maybe fly through both directions to make it harder.

## Simple Boat Race

Do S turns through the bridge behind the clubhouse and then do a straightaway on the way back.

## Find the targets

Find and shot targets hidden throughout the map. 5 minute time limit.

## Ramps to do a skatepark
